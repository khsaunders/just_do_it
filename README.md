# do_it

Have you ever looked at a todo list and felt a sense of dread creep over you?
You might have sat there, analyzing it for a few seconds, strategizing and gathering up the will to complete those tasks.
I've been there many times, friends.
That's why I made the Do It todo list. Keep your tasks organized in a clear and simple user interface and feel inspired each time you look at it.
Images featuring Shia LaBeouf accompanied by his moving, enthusiastic speech about following your dreams appear at the bottom of the app to give you that extra punch in the guy you need to take care of business.

"Don't let your dreams be dreams. Yesterday, you said you'd do it tomorrow."

Go do great things, people.
